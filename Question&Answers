Q> Fail Fast and Fail Safe Iterators in Java How it Works ?

Fail-Fast iterators immediately throw ConcurrentModificationException if there is structural modification of the collection. 
Structural modification means adding, removing or updating any element from collection while a thread is iterating over that collection. 
examples:  ArrayList, HashMap classses.
To know whether the collection is structurally modified or not, fail-fast iterators use an internal flag called modCount which is updated 
each time a collection is modified.Fail-fast iterators checks the modCount flag whenever it gets the next value (i.e. using next() method),
and if it finds that the modCount has been modified after this iterator has been created, it throws ConcurrentModificationException.

Fail-Safe iterators don’t throw any exceptions if a collection is structurally modified while iterating over it. This is because, they operate on the clone of the collection, not on the original collection and that’s why they are called fail-safe iterators. Iterator on CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap classes are examples of fail-safe Iterator.

Q> Advantages and disadvantages of static variable?

The static variables/methods belong to the class rather than an instance of the class.
They occupy memory in method area or pergem memory space where garbage collector never works .
You can not control creation and destruction of static variable. Usefully they have been created at program loading and 
destroyed when program unload (or when JVM shuts down).
so if we use static variable more there might be a change of cnsuming more memory which does not signify the purpose .
when do you need :then ?

---> Only use when a variable which is used globally ,Here global means across all the instances of a java class

Q> Difference b/w PATCH and PUT?
PUT means replace the entire ebject/ json
PATCH means modify a specific value in an object/json
 {
 id : "483843847",
 name: "jitu",
 age : "28",
 company : "xyz"
 }
 consider the above json , if i just wanted to modify company name to abc  , i can do it throught patch 
 but if i want to change the entire object i have to make a put call , and might be in request i need to send the entire object again .
 cann't you achive the behaviour of PATCH using PUT ?
 yes ! you can , but the payload(request body) size would be more containing the full object structure, which will make the request heavy.
