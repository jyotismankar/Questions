Q> in mmt sometimes upon clicking a calender we can see lowest fare of a flight but when we click the date we can see that price got changes to something else,
	and that flight also not there in the list , because that flight would have been departed  ? so how can you improve this case without any interaction with db ?

coviam 5th round zoom conference questions:

Q> design a trip adviser package system ?shared a link to write sample code for the same which he can access at the same time

(Note : while writing keep in mind , it shoule be thread safe , you implement using doubl locking principle, it should not be cloned
and if the class consists any other object mmake sure you are handing the case too)
