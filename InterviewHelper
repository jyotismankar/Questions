Q> ConcurrentHashMap internal implementation ?
Q> why does we need to call wait and notify inside synchronized area? what will happen if i call it outside the synchronized block ?
Q> give me a example where exactly in your application you have used multithreading ?
Q> in mmt sometimes upon clicking a calender we can see lowest fare of a flight but when we click the date we can see that price got changes to something else,
	and that flight also not there in the list , because that flight would have been departed  ? so how can you improve this case without any interaction with db ?
	case 1: you can think all the data you have in client which you would have received in your last sync call to server ?
Q> what is use of message Queue ? example a usecase of your application where have you used ?
Q> wave you used kafka ? and what is the use of kafpa, and have you ever thought to improvise your current way of implementation of message queue to kafka ?
	can you tell me a use case where do you think you can utilize it if not used so far ?

Q> suppose capacity of an ArrayList is 100(i definned): 
    i have filled 50 objects in it and tried to print 60th element what woule be the response ?
Q> find the missing number in an array which has all consecutive nos : 
    exa arr[] = {10,11,12,13,14,15}//find missing no give the optimal solution 
Q> take a input of numbers , and try to say if its power of 2 or not, if the no is power of 2 return true , 
    else return the next element which is power    of 2  ;
    exa: input : 4 return true;
         input : 5 return 8;

Q> in Employee class i implemented only equals(), and returning true inside the equals methods.
    i have created 50 employee objects and pushed into a set. what would be the size of set ? and why ?
Q> in Employee class i implemented only equals(), and returning false inside the equals methods.and implemeted hashcode returning '1' always

class child extends prent {
int x = 5;
int m1(){
sysout (x);
}
}
    
prent p = new child();
p.m1();o/p
Child c = new Child())
(c)p.m1();//o/p

PAYTM interview question :
system test :
Q> zigzag traversal of a tree ?
Q> Find the Minimum length Unsorted Subarray, sorting which makes the complete array sorted? (example i have taken form geeksforgeeks as its a direct question )
If the input array is [0, 1, 15, 25, 6, 7, 30, 40, 50], your program should be able to find that the subarray lies between the indexes 2 and 5.
