Q> what will happen if multiple thread try to access a value in  HashMap?
Q> ConcurrentHashMap internal implementation ?
Q> why does we need to call wait and notify inside synchronized area? what will happen if i call it outside the synchronized block ?
Q> give me a example where exactly in your application you have used multithreading ?
Q> in mmt sometimes upon clicking a calender we can see lowest fare of a flight but when we click the date we can see that price got changes to something else,

Q> find the missing number in an array which has all consecutive nos : 
    exa arr[] = {10,11,12,13,14,15}//find missing no give the optimal solution 
Q> take a input of numbers , and try to say if its power of 2 or not, if the no is power of 2 return true , 
    else return the next element which is power    of 2  ;
    exa: input : 4 return true;
         input : 5 return 8;

Q> in Employee class i implemented only equals(), and returning true inside the equals methods.
    i have created 50 employee objects and pushed into a set. what would be the size of set ? and why ?
Q> in Employee class i implemented only equals(), and returning false inside the equals methods.and implemeted hashcode returning '1' always

int x = 10;
int m1(){
sysout (x);
}
}  

class child extends prent {
int x = 5;
int m1(){
sysout (x);
}
}
    
prent p = new child();
p.m1();o/p
Child c = new Child())
(c)p.m1();//o/p
